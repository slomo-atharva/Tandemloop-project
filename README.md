First of all a big thanks to everyone at Tandemloop for giving me an opportunnity in the selection process.
I have replicated every section of the website attaced with the Email and made the mobile responsive version of those sections using the exact dimensions mentioned in the mail and for typography i used manrope font as mentioned. The primary tool used is Figma and i have tried to recreate the entire sections gave to me including some icons. I have done this work with true passion and i am looking for your response for this project.
